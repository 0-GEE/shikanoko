# A Discrete-time Markov Chain of Shikanoko

To use, simply place `command_ver/shikanoko` somewhere on your `PATH`, use `chmod +x` to give yourself
permission to execute it, and voila! Now you can have shikanoko anywhere anytime by invoking `shikanoko`!

Alternatively, you can just run the `shikanoko` script directly: `python3 command_ver/shikanoko`
